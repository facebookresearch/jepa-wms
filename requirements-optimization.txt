# Optimization libraries for JEPA-WMs
#
# WARNING: These packages require numpy>=1.24.0 and are incompatible with
# the base environment which uses numpy==1.23.3 and numba==0.56.4
#
# To use these optimization tools, you will need to create a separate
# virtual environment with compatible numpy versions, or upgrade your
# base environment's numpy (which will break numba compatibility).
#
# Installation in a separate environment:
#   python -m venv venv-optimization
#   source venv-optimization/bin/activate
#   pip install -r requirements-optimization.txt
#
# Or to upgrade your current environment (WARNING: may break numba):
#   pip install --upgrade numpy>=1.24.0
#   pip install -r requirements-optimization.txt

nevergrad>=1.0.12
cma>=4.3.0

qpsolvers>=4.8.0
